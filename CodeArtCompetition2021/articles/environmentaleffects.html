          <h3 class="ui header">Lessening The Environmental Effects of COVID-19</h3>
            <p>The effects of the coronavirus pandemic have been undeniably devastating. People’s businesses, dreams, and even lives have all been taken away by this calamity of a virus. However, the impacts do not end there, as there is another relatively unknown COVID-19 induced issue brewing: a plastic pandemic.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, as of now, plastic tends to be the main component in many items central to our new hygienic lifestyle, which everyone should follow for the sake of their health and the health of those around them. Single-use masks, most of which are made from polypropylene (a fossil fuel-derived plastic that takes decades to disintegrate), latex gloves, takeout containers, delivery packaging, and protective gear employed for sanitary measures are <B>exacerbating ocean pollution.</B> A glut of throwaway plastic is now apparent worldwide, from an abundance of medical waste washing up on the shores of Europe to bans on single-use plastic bags being lifted.</p>
            <p>Many countries that had ambitious goals to slash plastic waste this year have unfortunately not been able to follow through. For example, Thailand, who had banned disposable bags and planned to slash plastic waste by 50%, has now observed a thirty percent rise and consumed sixty-eight percent more plastic in April than it had in the past year. Furthermore, a market research firm, Frost& Sullivan, announced that the US was generating an entire year’s worth of medical waste in just a sixth of a year due to the pandemic.</p>
            <p>Sadly, since the United States lacks efficient recycling and waste services, a significant proportion of the plastic surplus will not be recycled. In fact, according to Columbia University, because the U.S. was dependent on China to recycle our trash for decades, our domestic recycling infrastructure was never even adequately developed. All of this has accumulated into the disaster we see today, which has horrifyingly pushed many environmentalists to fear that COVID-19 will reverse the momentum of a year’s long fight and pollute our world to reprehensible levels.</p>

          <p><ol style="font-size:20px" style="font-family:"'Lato', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" type="1" >
                   <li>Well, for starters, you can stay home. By staying inside, you won’t have the risk of spreading the disease to others, shortening the amount of time this virus will plague us for.</li>
             <br>
           <li>Next, you can fight for legislation that will effectively tackle climate change, starting with better recycling measures. Through this pandemic, we have witnessed firsthand the necessity of proactive measures. It is too late for us to recycle the plastic used before, but if we put the work in, we can fix our broken recycling system, stopping anything like this from ever happening again. </li>
         <br>
         <li>Finally, you can listen to health professionals’ and scientists’ advice on how to reuse face masks so that you can reduce your plastic usage.</li>
         <br>
         <ul>
      <li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explain that certain reusable cloth masks do adhere to guidelines. They recommend wearing two of these cloth masks to make a double layer. Some good options come from Lululemon, Tom Bihn, and Under Armour. The CDC suggests users wash their cloth masks by including the mask with regular laundry, using regular laundry detergent and the appropriate settings according to the fabric label. The CDC also tells users to wait until their masks are completely dry before reuse.</li>
      <br>
             <li>Before this advice is explained, it is essential that readers are aware that neither the World Health Organization, nor the CDC, advocate for the reuse of surgical masks. However, numerous scientists agree that if you are not infected or someone who is exposed to high viral loads, such as healthcare workers, there are ways you can reuse masks. Adios Corona—a group of scientists who provide information on COVID-19 to the public—recommends the seven-day method. This method is completed by placing the mask in a paper envelope and leaving it alone for a week. A study published in The Lancet, a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal, found that only 0.1% of the virus on the outside surface of the mask was still detectable after seven days. Peter Tsai, the inventor of N95 electrostatically charged filter material, also agrees with the seven-day method. Furthermore, Narayana Health, which operates a network of hospitals across India, says that while face masks should not be used once they are dirtied or the inner lining gets moist, there are rare cases where they can be sterilized for limited reuse. They explain that, if you want to reuse the mask, it must be kept dry, never left on any surfaces, and properly stored. When it comes to surgical masks, they recommend putting dry, intact masks into a zip lock bag with desiccated gel. It can be reused for three days with this method. For N95 respirators, the health officials recommend storing the masks in a dry atmosphere for 3-4 days. Another suggestion is to sterilize the N95 mask through heat by keeping the masks in an oven at 70 degrees C for half an hour. It is crucial that these masks do not touch metal. Additionally, since N95 masks are degraded by UV light, it is best to keep them away from any kind of UV light, including sunlight. If you are uncomfortable reusing masks (which is completely understandable), consider investing in an elastomeric half facepiece respirator. These are approved by the CDC for reuse.</li>
    </ul>
     </ol></p>
         <p>Ultimately, it is up to you to determine what you feel comfortable with. Clean Step wants readers to know that there is nothing wrong with disposing of masks if that is what makes you feel safe. Please know that the blame for the current plastic pandemic is not on your shoulders. We hope you stay safe during these troubling times.</p>
