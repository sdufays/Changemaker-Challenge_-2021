          <h3 class="ui header" ><I>"But What IS Climate Change?”</I></h3>
          <p>The Oxford dictionary defines climate change as “a change in global or regional climate patterns…, attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.”</p>
          <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, the earth has gradually been getting warmer, with the dominant cause being human activity driving up carbon emissions. Although it is true that there are natural fluctuations in the climate, scientists have proven that temperatures are now rising at an unprecedented rate.</p>
          <p>This is mainly attributed to the greenhouse effect: certain gases in Earth’s atmosphere block heat from escaping, thus increasing the earth’s temperature.</p>
          <p>In particular, carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for most of the world’s emissions and their increase. Most man-made carbon emissions originate from burning fossil fuels, which produces about 35 billion tonnes of CO2  per year. Since the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, levels have risen more than 30%. Nowadays, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is the highest it has been in at least 800,000 years. Because of this, 86% of land ecosystems are becoming less efficient at absorbing CO2, which is exacerbating the problem. </p>

           </p>
          <p>Since climate change affects every aspect of human existence, a ‘climate catastrophe’ will drastically slow economic growth and severely damage our society’s infrastructure, with no country being spared. According to the National Climate Assessment, this will be the case if society fails to lower global emissions in the following decade.</p>
          <p>Many people regard the climate crisis as a faraway, exaggerated threat, but what many people fail to recognize is the interdependence that is present. In the absence of any progressive measures, climate change has the potential to develop into an even greater economic and health threat than the pandemic ravaging so many lives. </p>
          <p>According to Bill Gates, “the loss of life and economic misery caused by this pandemic are on par with what will happen regularly if we do not eliminate the world’s carbon emissions.” In just two decades, climate change could develop into a crisis equally as deadly as the coronavirus, and by 2100, it is forewarned that its impacts will be five times as destructive. Additionally, many organizations––including the World Health Organization––have stated that the importance of this crisis is crucial to prevent further pandemics and diseases from reaching human civilization and spreading. The dismantling of the earth’s defense systems and the increase of temperatures are in fact opening the gates for the spread of disease.</p>
          <p><B>These are not backless claims.</B> Scientific evidence for warming of the climate system and its impacts are unequivocal. Between observed global temperature rises, warming oceans, shrinking ice sheets, glacial retreats, decreased snow cover, sea level rise, a declining arctic area, ocean acidification, and extreme high temperature events/storms, the scientific evidence is literally indisputable.  </p>
          <p>And for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. For every ton of CO2 that is released into the atmosphere, and for every acre of land that sustains oxygen-producing and atmospheric-carbon-reducing organisms, that is destroyed, <B>the future world and economy will suffer.</B>  The amount of money generated in the world’s economies will drastically decrease, whether it is due to more frequent storms that destroy our infrastructure, heat waves and hotter temperatures that will affect agriculture and our food supply, or even extreme weather events that we have little control over.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>
          <p>Unless we implement change, a climate catastrophe is certain to occur. It’s easy to turn a blind eye and be skeptical, but what everyone fails to acknowledge is that society is living through its preliminary effects firsthand right now. The World Health Organization estimates that as of now, 150,000 deaths are directly correlated to climate change annually. This number is expected to increase.</p>
          <p>Climate change is disrupting the physical and structural foundations of modern society. Every year, there is more of an increase in heat waves, which happens to be the number one cause of weather-related deaths. Just last year, fires in California destroyed over a thousand structures, burned millions of acres, and killed over 30 individuals. According to the MIT Technology Review, ‘Climate scientists, who long resisted linking global warming to any specific extreme event, now say its influence is all but certain.”’ And yet, as these sorts of situations increase in so many ways, not enough progress is being made.</p>

            <img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/nWOV9V2bwo/climate-change-florida-topography.JPG" width="800" height="500">
           </p>
          <p>Few places on the planet are more at risk from the climate crisis than the inhabitants of South Florida. Over 9 million people in South Florida are affected by the convergence of almost every modern environmental challenge: from rising seas to contaminated drinking water, more frequent and powerful hurricanes, coastal erosion, flooding, and vanishing wildlife and habitat. Just on January 29th, DeSantis called for one billion dollars as Florida braces for future climate change impacts. This is not a costless battle.</p>
          <p>Below are some of the larged threats posed by the climate crisis to south Florida today: </p>
          <br>
          <p><B>Rising sea levels </B></p>
          <p><I>Live by the beach?</I></p>
          <p>Regardless of which estimation and scientific study you are looking at, Florida is drowning. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that Florida’s sea level is devastatingly rising.  This rapid increase could lead to 25 times more flooding capable of causing “significant risks to life and property.” It is increasingly being viewed as a “force multiplier”—making natural events and challenges even more severe—and as a reality of our climate crisis. According to a CBS Miami Study, many of Miami Beach’s landmarks, such the Keys, the world famous South Beach, and the picturesque art hotels of Ocean Drive, have a high likelihood of being lost within three decades.</p>
          <br>
          <p><B>Water contamination</B></p>
          <p><I>Enjoy clean, pure water?</I></p>
          <p>Well, climate change is predicted to increase the need for water. Higher temperatures increase the rate at which water evaporates, meaning that both irrigated farmland and Floridians would require more water. The demand for water is likely to increase over 25%; however, the likelihood that our access to water is going to increase is highly improbable.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, as saltwater from sea level seeps further inland, our freshwater supplies are being contaminated. Notably, in the Biscayne Aquifer, where South Florida gets most of its water from, scientists and engineers are struggling to prevent this salt water intrusion from contaminating its supply.</p>
          <p>The Florida department of environmental protection warned in March of 2020 that “existing sources of water will not adequately meet the reasonable beneficial needs for the next 20 years.” This isn’t something that will happen overnight. It’s happening right now. The city of Hallandale Beach has already abandoned six of its eight drinking water wells because the water was becoming too salty to drink. A rising water table has additionally exacerbated problems with south Florida’s sewage systems: since December of 2019, millions of gallons of toxic sewage have spilled onto Fort Lauderdale’s streets from pipe failures.</p>
          <br>
          <p><B>Storms</B></p>
          <p><I>Hate hurricanes?</I></p>
          <p>In the past 20 years, tropical storms and hurricanes have become increasingly intense. Warming oceans provide these storms with more potential energy, creating increasing rainfall, flooding rates, and hurricane winds.</p>
          <p>Every part of Florida - cities, roads, railways, ports, and water supplies - is vulnerable to the impacts of storms and sea level rise. The implications are far-reaching for both coastal residents and insurers. According to a recent study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with current climate change trends, there is a global increase of about 8 percent per decade of the likelihood that a given tropical cyclone will become a Category 3 or greater storm. Additionally, hurricane destruction in the United States, in terms of physical damage costs, has historically increased by 10 percent for every 5 mph increase in wind speed.</p>
          <p><B>The impacts of climate change on Florida don’t end here.</B></p>
          <p>Agriculture is affected; disease carriers like mosquitoes spread; the tourism industry loses value; our beaches are eroded; flooding is exacerbated; ocean acidification harms our marine resources; our air becomes more and more more polluted… And for what? Short-term comfort?</p>
          <p><B>This crisis affects every single one of us,</B> regardless of political standing or economic state.</p>
          <p> It is not the time to be complacent.</p>
